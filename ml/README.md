# Machine Learning Section
This is Machine Learning Section of this repo. You can find our scrapping module, training Notebook and our inference module for deployment. Our dataset can be accessed [here](https://drive.google.com/).

We performed transfer learning on already trained `mobilenet_v2` to classify three different places: 
| Place Name | Label Number |
| ------ | ------ |
| Braga Street, Bandung  | 0  | 
| Kawah Putih, Bandung  | 1  | 
| Monumen Perjuangan, Bandung  | 2 | 

and managed to achieve 96% on validation accuracy and 97% on training accuracy. More details can be seen on our [notebook](https://github.com/perfect-less/KemanaKita/blob/main/ml/projekBangkit.ipynb).
